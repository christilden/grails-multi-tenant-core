You will probably want a way to verify that each tenant has access to their application. If you add a bean to spring named "tenantStatusChecker" that implements the "TenantStatusChecker" interface grails.plugin.multitenant.core.TenantStatusChecker, then this plugin will automatically validate each request and redirect to /noaccess.gsp if the tenant doesn't have access.

This is pretty clunky and we have plans to make it much better in the future...
