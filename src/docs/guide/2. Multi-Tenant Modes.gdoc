The webapp always runs in multi-tenant mode, but you have the choice on how your database will operate. You can choose either one database per customer (single-tenant), or one database for all customers (multi-tenant).

In Config.groovy, add the following section:

{code}
tenant {
    mode = "singleTenant" // OR "multiTenant"
}
{code}

{warning}multiTenant is the default{warning}
